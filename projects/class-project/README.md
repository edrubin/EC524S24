# Class project

## Project description

<!-- **Group** Create a two-person group. (You can work alone if you want, but the expectations will be the same as for a two-person group.) -->

**Topic** Select a prediction-related topic and "register" it with me (Ed).

- The topic should be related to something we talked about it class, but it cannot be something we directly covered. The idea is to extend our course topics to new applications/areas.
- You should have a motivation for why this topic is interesting/important.
- You should also have a good example of an application of this topic.
- **Still important** People cannot overlap in topics. First mover wins.

## Materials due

Your topic is due by the end of the day on **May 3rd**.

By midnight on **June 3rd**, submit **two documents** on Canvas (share links or upload files):

1. an HTML notebook of the Wiki explanation of your topic that includes the intuition, math, and example (including code)
1. slides for a five-minute presentation explaining the topic and showing your example 

**NOTE:** No late submissions.

## Claimed topics

| Topic | Name |
